       "   'body': 'Treasury\\'s top sanctions official Brian Nelson will travel to the southern border Tuesday as part of the department\\'s ongoing push to crack down on the cartels and illicit financial networks fueling the deadly fentanyl trade, Treasury officials told CNN. Nelson\\'s trip -- his second in sixth months -- and a spate of recent sanctions activity is the latest indicator that Treasury is ramping up efforts to tackle the illegal fentanyl trade through actions that disrupt the supply chains funneling \"precursor\" chemicals from China to producers in Mexico where much of the deadly drug is made. Nelson and Treasury officials will meet with fellow law enforcement representatives, including from the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, as well as private financial institutions and local officials.  \"What we are doing is trying to be as effective as we possibly can in combining Treasury\\'s tools with the efforts that other US government agencies and allied governments are deploying in this space,\" said Nelson, the under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at Treasury, in an interview with CNN. The engagements over the 48-hour trip will provide officials an opportunity to discuss how Treasury\\'s tools and information can complement law enforcement and to learn about the big issues and patterns that agents are seeing on the ground. The trip is also aimed at exploring how trends and information from the extensive financial information Treasury collects can be helpful to the broader government-wide effort to quell the synthetic opioid epidemic. Nelson, who will also be joined by the acting director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Himamauli Das, will visit Laredo and San Antonio in Texas on Tuesday and Wednesday. In Laredo, Nelson will receive briefings on border operations from CBP officials at the city\\'s port of entry as well as discuss cargo processing and inspections.  \"There\\'s a credible value in seeing that in person,\" Nelson said. In San Antonio, Nelson and Das will host a \"FinCEN Exchange,\" which is a public-private information sharing forum where Treasury can share the different patterns and connections they\\'re seeing with financial institutions, as well as discuss further ways the federal government can partner with the private sector to better spot red flags and identify illicit financial networks. The department has been involved in the counter-narcotics business for decades, using its tools and financial expertise to both starve criminal organizations of critical financing through sanctions and blocking assets, as well as providing crucial financial data to other law enforcement and federal agencies. \"We can help disrupt financial flows and target the whole supply chain, starting with the precursor chemicals all the way down to distributors bound for US markets. And it\\'s not just sanctions,\" Nelson said, pointing also to FinCEN\\'s financial mapping tools as well as Treasury\\'s focus on cooperating with Mexico to improve their capacity to trace and combat illicit finance. \"These tools, combined with financial mapping that our FinCEN team does, is very, very powerful insight,\" he added. Investigators from the Treasury, especially those at FinCEN, can access and share powerful financial data with enforcement bodies like the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Department of Homeland Security and others as they work to track and disrupt the fentanyl trade and drug suppliers. Nelson also said that Treasury is \"absolutely\" looking to build on US Secretary of State Antony Blinken\\'s latest engagements in China, which included discussing where the two nations could cooperate on curbing the flow of precursor chemicals from China. Blinken, who traveled to Beijing last month, said both sides agreed to \"explore\" establishing a working group on the precursor chemicals used to produce the deadly synthetic drug. There has been a government-wide push to curb synthetic opioids like fentanyl, which are the main driver of overdose deaths in the US. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there has been a more than seven-fold increase overall in deaths from 2015-2021, and despite a recent slowing, overdose deaths still hover near record levels and remain the third leading cause of death in adolescents aged 19 and younger. In April, the Biden administration announced a broad effort to target the production and distribution of fentanyl, which included criminal charges from the Department of Justice and a host of new Treasury sanctions. It was an announcement that built off of an executive order signed in 2021 that expanded Treasury\\'s authorities to target the distribution chains of fentanyl and other narcotics, which Nelson said has been critical to helping Treasury \"increase the pace at which we are able to target and designate the key nodes in fentanyl distribution.\" Since then, Treasury has continued to issue sanctions against precursor chemical supply networks, particularly in China, as well as other corrupt activity like arms trafficking and money laundering that helps support the trade.',\n",

       "   'body': 'President Joe Biden said before a critical trip to Europe that Ukraine is not yet ready to enter NATO. More to the point, the alliance is not yet ready for Ukraine to join in a historic step that could deter Moscow but that might also increase the risk of a US-Russia war. Biden has staked his foreign policy legacy on arming Ukraine to repel the Russian invasion -- most recently with a contentious decision to send cluster bombs. But he nevertheless sent a strong message to Kyiv in an exclusive CNN interview that its increasingly sharp campaign is unlikely to result in a certain date for NATO entry emerging from the alliance\\'s summit in Lithuania this week.  While some eastern European alliance members are bullish on an early timetable to welcome Ukraine, some first-generation states, including the US, are more cautious, partly due to fears that moving quickly on NATO membership could provoke the direct conflict with Russia that Biden is desperate to avoid. \"I don\\'t think there is unanimity in NATO about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war,\" Biden said in an interview with CNN\\'s Fareed Zakaria broadcast on Sunday. The president said that the alliance needed to lay out a \"rational path\" for Ukraine\\'s membership but that it was still short of some requirements for joining, including over democratization. While Biden said he had discussed the issue at length with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and had refused before the war to allow Russian President Vladimir Putin a veto on Kyiv\\'s eventual membership, his comments will disappoint Ukraine as it suffers through a horrific war that has seen multiple crimes against humanity. Ukraine has often warned it is fighting the West\\'s war against Russian expansionism and has weakened NATO\\'s top adversary in Europe, and so therefore has a moral case for the defense guarantees NATO states enjoy. But even Zelensky accepts that Ukraine cannot join NATO while the war rages on.  Still, he hinted in an interview with ABC News aired Sunday that he wouldn\\'t be a guest at the NATO summit \"for fun\" and could stay away unless there was more clarity on membership and security guarantees. \"It would be an important message to say that NATO is not afraid of Russia,\" he said.  A fateful decision  Deciding whether Ukraine joins NATO is one of the most fateful European security questions since waves of expansion took the alliance right up to Russia\\'s borders in a process advocates say guaranteed post-Cold War peace by deterring Kremlin aggression. Critics of enlargement into formerly Soviet Eastern Europe, however, argue the process humiliated Moscow, turned it back into an avowed foe of the West and helped lead to the invasion of Ukraine. A decision to admit Ukraine would extend the sacred NATO pledge that an attack on one member is an attack on all to a nation Russia regards, at a minimum, as part of its sphere of influence -- even if such a claim has no basis in international law. It would commit future Western leaders to go to war with nuclear-armed Russia and potentially risk a third World War if the Kremlin attacked its neighbor again.  Supporters of Ukraine\\'s membership in NATO, however, argue that decades of security and territorial integrity provided to ex-Warsaw Pact nations like Poland, Hungary and Romania are in itself proof that once under NATO\\'s mutual defense umbrella, Ukraine would at last be safe from future incursions by Moscow. The argument is especially resonant since summit host Lithuania, like its fellow Baltic states Latvia and Estonia, was once annexed by the Soviet Union and considered highly vulnerable to Russia before its entry into NATO in 2004. The case for Ukraine in NATO Broadly, the case for NATO welcoming Ukraine includes those ironclad security guarantees that would be designed to dispel its vulnerability to Russian attack. Supporters of Kyiv\\'s accession point out that a vague promise of future membership -- first made at its summit in Bucharest in 2008 with no realistic timetable for entry -- offered Putin an incentive to invade before Ukraine joined the club.  NATO membership would also boost Ukraine\\'s bid to cement a democracy that was vulnerable before the war and fulfill the desire of many of its people to join the West. With its brutal war, Moscow has forfeited any moral say in whether Ukraine should join or not. And the addition of Europe\\'s most battle-hardened army, with more personnel under arms than most member states, would stiffen NATO\\'s military punch. Sens. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, and Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, last week introduced a resolution calling for a roadmap to Ukraine\\'s NATO membership as soon as it is practicable. \"It is only through NATO membership that Ukraine can experience true security in the face of repeated Russian aggression,\" the senators said in a statement. \"Their fight has been a stand against corrupt crony authoritarianism and they have earned a secure and lasting peace within NATO.\" The case against There are short- and long-term arguments against NATO offering membership to Ukraine. Biden warned in his CNN interview that to do so in a time of war would immediately commit the alliance to defend a new partner -- to prove the group\\'s collective defense is meaningful. \"I mean what I say,\" the president said. \"It\\'s a commitment that we\\'ve all made no matter what. If the war is going on, then we\\'re all in war. We\\'re at war with Russia, if that were the case.\"  Offering Ukraine a set date to join after the war ends might be counterproductive since it would give the Kremlin a rationale for never ending the conflict. This would dash admittedly thin hopes for a political settlement if Ukraine\\'s forces are ultimately unable to expel all Russian forces. And it would risk strengthening Putin at home by appearing to justify one of his rationales for the unprovoked invasion -- his baseless allegation that the West triggered the war to claim Ukraine in a bid to weaken Russian power. As he headed to the United Kingdom on the first leg of his European visit, Biden got an endorsement of his strategy from GOP Rep. Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who said it was \"way too premature\" to talk about Ukraine immediately joining NATO. \"First they have to win the counteroffensive, secondly, have a cease-fire, and then negotiate a peace settlement. We cannot admit Ukraine into NATO immediately. That would put us at war with Russia,\" the Texas Republican said on CNN\\'s \"State of the Union\" on Sunday.  \"So I think what the conversation is going to be about is, what security agreements can be put in place with Ukraine as a predicate to perhaps ascension of Ukraine into NATO?\" he said, adding, \"We have to be careful in the way we do this.\" US and European security guarantees to Ukraine -- beyond the multi-billion dollar effort to arm the country to fend off Russia\\'s threat -- would change the strategic picture in Western Europe. They would also be made with no guarantee that the Kremlin would become more benign toward the West in future decades. But there is no reason, for example, why the US and its allies cannot make a commitment to offer Ukraine the means to defend itself -- short of NATO membership -- much as the US does with Israel and Taiwan. The risk of a clash with Russia in the future weighs heavily on the minds of many analysts. \"The United States should not guarantee Ukrainian security. Period,\" said Ben Friedman, policy director at Defense Priorities, a think tank dedicated to promoting a realist vision of national security policy. \"We shouldn\\'t do so now, via NATO or otherwise (through) some sort of bilateral security guarantees, and we shouldn\\'t do so as part of a peace deal.\"  Friedman argued that despite Ukraine\\'s heroic resistance, wider considerations of Washington\\'s interests must take priority. \"Guaranteeing Ukraine\\'s security would erode US security by increasingly the risk, obviously, of war with Russia,\" he said. \"That contains the risk, of course, of nuclear escalation, and for that risk I think the United States receives basically nothing of security value.\" Neither Biden, nor any other member of his administration have made a case to the American people as to why ultimately it would be in the interest of 330 million Americans to go to war with Moscow to defend Ukraine if it joined NATO. In fact, the president has made an opposite, implicit case, stressing that despite a proxy-war type situation in Ukraine, his core concern is avoiding a direct clash with Russia. Advocates of NATO welcoming Ukraine often argue that no such undertaking was secured from American voters regarding other formally communist Eastern European states once in the Soviet Union\\'s orbit. But Ukraine could be more at risk since it carries greater cultural and historical associations -- and, for Russia, it is linked to its self-identity, whether justified or not. One potential downfall of offering Ukraine eventual security guarantees through NATO or another mechanism would be if political will to enforce them ebbs in future. A failure to defend such guarantees would raise grave doubts about NATO\\'s existing mutual defense ethos and could end up disastrously weakening the integrity of the alliance.  Even if Biden were to amend his position on accelerating NATO membership for Ukraine, he cannot ensure a successor would honor treaty obligations. Indeed, ex-President Donald Trump has been loudly warning that Biden is leading the US into a potential World War III against Russia, and he has insisted he\\'d end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours if elected to a new term. Such comments suggest more sympathy to the goals of Putin, to whom he has often cozied up.  The uncertain political situation in the US may be one reason why Zelensky has appeared so desperate to ensure his country\\'s urgent NATO aspirations are set in stone at this week\\'s summit.',\n",

       "   'body': 'President Joe Biden embarks on a weeklong trip to Europe on Sunday, and the stakes couldn\\'t be higher for the future of the NATO alliance.  Biden makes a stop in London ahead of his attendance at the NATO Summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, followed by meetings with Nordic leaders in Helsinki, Finland. The backdrop, of course, is Russia\\'s ongoing war in Ukraine and last month\\'s failed coup attempt in Russia, posing the biggest threat to global stability for the alliance in recent history.  Biden will be a key player on a host of critical issues for the alliance as they gather in Vilnius, a city on NATO\\'s eastern frontier that sits approximately 20 miles from the Belarusian border. The summit will present a key test for the alliance\\'s continued remarkable level of unity after Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine -- and its credibility.    There will be questions about a pathway for Ukraine to joining NATO, and whether members are able to agree on Sweden\\'s bid for accession. Also at issue is the next steps for the war a month into Ukraine\\'s counteroffensive, questions about a potential endgame, and what long-term security assistance the leaders can offer to Ukraine.  A war on NATO\\'s borders  Ukraine\\'s path to NATO membership is taking on increasing urgency and is likely to be one of the biggest flash points for the group as the war drags on -- especially in the aftermath of Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin\\'s abortive mutiny, which exposed cracks in Russian President Vladimir Putin\\'s military leadership and posed a potentially existential threat to his regime.  NATO first welcomed Ukraine\\'s membership aspirations during a 2008 meeting in Bucharest, Romania, but little progress has been made and the timeline remains uncertain. And while the US has said Ukraine will not be joining NATO as a member coming out of this meeting, the Vilnius summit presents a critical opportunity to take tangible steps toward that end in an important show of unity.  \"Ukraine and many NATO allies are calling for a clearer pathway, a roadmap, some kind of statement at Vilnius that will show Ukraine what it needs to do to get into the alliance. And I think that is very important to happen for the alliance to be credible. Given the stakes of the war, ... given what the Ukrainians have endured, if we walk out of Vilnius without a firmer sense of what it will take to get Ukraine into the alliance, I worry about the alliance\\'s credibility,\" said Chris Skaluba, director of the Transatlantic Security Initiative in the Atlantic Council\\'s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security.   But Biden will be a key player in determining what specific, measurable criteria or timelines, if any, are offered to Ukraine for NATO membership during this summit.  Biden and members of his administration have remained committed to the alliance\\'s current posture. However, NATO countries in Eastern Europe bordering Ukraine or Russia have made a stronger push for a commitment to extend membership to Ukraine, including providing a more concrete timetable, which has created tension within the alliance leading up to the summit. And an early June letter calling for a clearer path to be laid out at the summit was signed by the Foreign Affairs Committee chairs from 22 nations, including US House Foreign Affairs Chairman Rep. Michael McCaul.  National security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that Vilnius \"will be an important moment on that pathway towards membership,\" providing an opportunity for members \"to discuss the reforms that are still necessary for Ukraine to come up to NATO standards.\"  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told CNN in an exclusive interview that giving Ukraine an invitation to NATO would be important motivation for Ukrainian soldiers. \"This signal is really very important and depends on Biden\\'s decision,\" Zelensky told CNN earlier this month. The divide has prompted urgent discussions ahead of the summit, and the result of the conversations could determine whether Zelensky attends.  \"If we are not acknowledged and given a signal in Vilnius, I believe there is no point for Ukraine to be at this summit,\" Zelensky told the Wall Street Journal in June.  Sweden\\'s accession  Observers will also be closely watching how the leaders interact with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as he continues to block Sweden\\'s bid to join the alliance. Finland and Sweden formally applied to be part of the security alliance in May 2022, propelled by Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, and Finland was admitted this April. But Turkey\\'s objections to Sweden\\'s efforts continue, which could prove a major embarrassment and source of weakness for the alliance.  Sweden\\'s NATO membership is \"within reach,\" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a news briefing following a meeting of senior officials from Turkey, Sweden and Finland Thursday. Stoltenberg expressed optimism for a \"positive decision\" and said he would meet with the Turkish and Swedish leaders in Vilnius next Monday.  In a notable show of support from the US, Biden welcomed his Swedish counterpart, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, to the White House Wednesday.  \"The bottom line is simple: Sweden is going to make our alliance stronger and has the same value set that we have in NATO. And I\\'m really looking -- anxiously looking forward for your membership,\" Biden told Kristersson during a meeting in the Oval Office.  While Sweden\\'s leadership is playing a leading role in the negotiations, leaders will also be looking to Biden for what the US can offer to Turkey to grease the wheels. Turkey wants the US Congress to approve its purchase of US-made F-16 fighter jets. While US officials are reluctant to tie the Sweden issue and F-16s overtly, officials say that behind the scenes there is an obvious deal to be done.  Biden on Sunday \"conveyed his desire to welcome Sweden into NATO as soon as possible\" during a call with Erdoğan as the US president flew to the United Kingdom, the White House said in a readout. The two leaders, according to the readout, \"discussed the range of issues that NATO leaders will consider at the summit, expressed their shared commitment to continue supporting Ukraine, and reviewed efforts to strengthen our bilateral ties.\" Erdoğan is set to meet with Stoltenberg and Kristersson on Monday in Vilnius. The question of Sweden\\'s membership is not expected to be fully resolved during the summit -- it will take a parliamentary procedure to formally approve -- and leaders will be looking to Erdoğan for any signal that he is willing to remove the hold and eliminate any questions about the alliance\\'s solidarity.  \"It would be a real failure for the alliance if it\\'s not able to get Sweden over the goal line here, and it\\'s a failure because it\\'s being held up by one member, Turkey,\" said Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program and Stuart Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  Bergmann continued, \"If Sweden is not a member come the Vilnius summit ... I think it really will lead to a confrontation with Turkey over whether Turkey, in fact, belongs in the alliance.\"  Assistance to Ukraine  As leaders gather, experts are watching for whether the alliance can offer any additional long-term security assistance to Ukraine, including the possibility of additional F-16 fighter jets and other long-term investments as a key signal to Russia of NATO\\'s long-term support for Ukraine.  In a major step during the G7 Summit in May, Biden informed G7 leaders that the US will support a joint effort with allies and partners to train Ukrainian pilots on fourth generation aircraft, including F-16s, a process that can take several months to complete.  \"Right now, Ukraine is being supported in a very short-term way, that we are appropriating money and getting that money out the door as fast as possible to meet Ukraine\\'s defense needs for the current counter offensive,\" said Bergmann.  However, he added, \"It\\'s critically important to make a long-term financial commitment here to really send a message to the Russians that they are not going to win a long war and that our commitment to Ukraine will last,\" noting the importance of such a commitment alongside the element of uncertainty surrounding the US 2024 presidential election.  The Indo-Pacific will also be a key topic for discussion among the leaders after they condemned the harms caused by China\\'s \"non-transparent market distorting industrial practices,\" in a communique wrapping the summit last year in Madrid.  Biden is also set to deliver what Sullivan described as a \"significant address\" in Vilnius \"about his vision of a strong, confident America flanked by strong, confident allies and partners, taking on the significant challenges of our time, from Russia\\'s aggression in Ukraine to the climate crisis.\" London calling Before the Vilnius summit kicks off, Biden will first visit the United Kingdom, where he will meet with King Charles III for their first one-on-one engagement since he ascended to the throne. In keeping with tradition, Biden did not travel to London for the coronation, but first lady Dr. Jill Biden and granddaughter Finnegan Biden attended the ceremony.  Biden has previously said he hopes to discuss environmental issues during his visit to Windsor Castle. It will be a closely watched moment for how the monarch balances his traditionally apolitical role with a cause he is passionate about.  Biden and the king, Sullivan said, will \"engage with a forum that will focus on mobilizing climate finance, especially bringing private finance off the sidelines for clean energy deployment and adaptation in developing countries.\" And the president will also meet with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, whom he hosted at the White House last month and with whom he has consulted closely on Ukraine and other foreign policy matters.  A Nordic gathering  Biden will also offer a notable show of support to Nordic countries following the Vilnius summit, traveling to Helsinki, Finland, for a summit with the leaders of Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland and Denmark, marking the third such summit and the first of the Biden administration.  With Sweden\\'s NATO membership still in the balance, the tone of this meeting could be highly contingent on what, if any, progress can be made in Vilnius.  But there are other ripe areas for discussion, a Nordic official told CNN, including security cooperation, particularly in the Arctic, where there is a presence from both China and Russia. They are also expected to discuss areas of cooperation on technology, including 5G and artificial intelligence technology. And climate engagement and clean energy will also be key topics during the Helsinki visit.  This story has been updated with additional information.',\n",

       "   'body': 'A top House Republican said Sunday he agreed with the Biden administration\\'s contentious decision to supply cluster munitions to Ukraine as part of a new military aid package, while a prominent progressive Democrat said the US risks \"losing our moral leadership\" over the move. House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, and Rep. Barbara Lee, a California Democrat, made their remarks in separate interviews with CNN\\'s Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union.\"  McCaul said the weapons \"would be a game-changer\" in the war in Ukraine, noting that \"Russia is dropping with impunity cluster bombs\" on Ukrainian territory.  \"All the Ukrainians and (President Volodymyr) Zelensky are asking for is to give them the same weapons the Russians have to use in their own country against Russians who are in their own country,\" he said. \"They do not want these to be used in Russia.\" The munitions, also known as cluster bombs, spread shrapnel that is designed to kill troops or take out armored vehicles such as tanks, but they also scatter \"bomblets\" across large areas that can fail to explode on impact and can pose a long-term risk to anyone who encounters them, similar to landmines.  Over 100 countries, including the UK, France and Germany, have outlawed the munitions under the Convention on Cluster Munitions, but the US and Ukraine are not signatories to the ban -- a point that McCaul emphasized on Sunday. CNN previously reported that President Joe Biden mulled over the decision before approving the weapons transfer on Friday.  Biden said in an interview with CNN\\'s Fareed Zakaria that it was a \"difficult decision\" but he was ultimately convinced to send the controversial weapons because Kyiv needs ammunition in its counteroffensive against Russia. US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told ABC on Sunday that the administration was \"mindful of the concerns about civilian casualties\" but reiterated that Ukrainian forces plan to use the cluster munitions to \"defend their own territory, hitting Russian positions.\" National security adviser Jake Sullivan sought Sunday to downplay any concern that Biden\\'s decision would present any \"fracture\" with allied countries that oppose the use of such weapons ahead of the president\\'s high-stakes trip to Europe.  \"We have heard nothing from people saying this cast doubt on our commitment, this cast doubt on coalition unity or this cast doubt on our belief that the United States is playing a vital and positive role as leader of this coalition in Ukraine,\" he told reporters traveling with Biden en route to London.  \\'Crossing a line\\' Lee, however, told CNN that cluster bombs \"should never be used. That\\'s crossing a line.\"  \"They don\\'t always immediately explode. Children can step on them,\" she said. \"The president\\'s been doing a good job managing this war, this Putin aggressive war against Ukraine. But I think that this should not happen.\" Asked by Tapper if the US could be engaging in war crimes by providing the weaponry, Lee said, \"What I think is that we ... would risk losing our moral leadership because, when you look at the fact that over 120 countries have signed the convention on cluster munitions saying that they should never be used, they should never be used.\" The remarks underscore the sensitivity surrounding cluster munitions, which US forces began phasing out in 2016 because of the danger they pose to civilians.  Another Democrat, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, said Sunday he appreciated that the Biden administration \"grappled with the risk and reached agreements with the Ukrainian military\" about the use of the munitions but he has \"real qualms\" about the decision.  \"There is an international prohibition. And the US says, \\'But here is a good reason to do something different.\\' It could give a green light to other nations to do something different as well,\" Kaine said.  Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, welcomed the sending of cluster munitions to Ukraine but said the US was taking \"too long\" to supply weapons to the country.   \"The best thing we can do now is to step up,\" Barrasso told Fox News. \"It just does seem to me there is so much delay in the activity of this administration and ultimately getting to Ukraine what they need.\" Afghanistan withdrawal Lee and McCaul also diverged Sunday on the chaotic 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan, which has reemerged as a topic after the recent release of a State Department report that found that both the Trump and Biden administrations\\' decisions to pull all US troops from Afghanistan had detrimental consequences. \"I don\\'t believe the (Biden) administration deserves any blame for this,\" Lee said. \"We have to remember that Donald Trump made this agreement with the Taliban. Secondly, the Trump administration literally gutted our State Department and our diplomatic corps. I believe that the State Department and those who were involved in the end of the Afghanistan war, which should have happened before then, I believe, did the best they could,\" Lee said.  McCaul called the report \"damaging\" and said the entire ordeal was a \"huge foreign policy blunder.\" The report was publicly released on June 30, more than a year after the 90-day review of the evacuation was completed and includes findings around the tumultuous final weeks of the US presence in Afghanistan, as well as several recommendations for improvement moving forward.  The Biden administration\\'s frenzied withdrawal after 20 years of US involvement has come under immense scrutiny by predominantly Republican lawmakers. However, accusations about who was responsible for the chaotic final weeks have fallen largely along party lines, with Republicans pointing fingers at the Biden administration and Democrats, including the White House, casting blame on the Trump administration for the deal that set the US withdrawal into motion.  Asked on June 30 about the report and whether he admitted there were \"mistakes during the withdrawal,\" Biden noted that he had vowed that al Qaeda \"wouldn\\'t be there.\" \"I said we\\'d get help from the Taliban,\" the president said. \"I was right.\"  McCaul on Sunday said the president\\'s response was \"devoid of reality.\" \"It\\'s a little bit eerie that a president of the United States would ... be so disillusioned about what\\'s happening on the ground in Afghanistan, the idea that al Qaeda is gone,\" the Texas Republican said. \"He just really wants to sweep Afghanistan under the rug.\" Since retaking control of Afghanistan, the Taliban has rolled back decades of progress on human rights. According to a recent report by United Nations experts, the Taliban has committed \"egregious systematic violations of women\\'s rights,\" by restricting their access to education and employment and their ability to move freely in society.

       "   'body': 'Ten al-Shabaab members were killed by airstrikes conducted by US Africa Command in Somalia in the overnight hours of Saturday, the Defense Department announced.  \"At the request of the Federal Government of Somalia, U.S. Africa Command conducted three collective self-defense airstrikes overnight in a remote area near Afmadow, approximately 105 kilometers north of Kismayo, against al-Shabaab terrorists,\" US Africa Command said in a statement Sunday.  The initial assessment of the Somali National Army and US Africa Command found that 10 members of the terrorist group were killed and there were no civilian casualties, per the statement.  Al-Shabaab is the largest and most active al Qaeda network in the world, according to the US Africa Command. The group controlled a vast area of Somalia before being pushed back by government counteroffensives last year, according to Reuters. However, the militants continue to launch lethal attacks across the country with the aim of toppling the central government and establishing a rule based on its strict interpretation of Islam\\'s Sharia law.  In late May, al-Shabaab fighters launched an attack on an African Union military base in Somalia, in which at least 54 Ugandan soldiers were killed, according to Ugandan officials. The US has provided ongoing support to the Somali government since President Joe Biden last year approved a Pentagon request to redeploy US troops to the area in an attempt to counter the terrorist group.  The approval to send fewer than 500 troops was a reversal of former President Donald Trump\\'s 2020 decision to withdraw nearly all US troops from the country.  The US has launched a number of strikes against al-Shabaab this year, including one that killed 30 fighters in January and three in February that killed a total of 24 soldiers.',\n",
